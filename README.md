# Change_Hashcode_for_image
Are you tired of taking new pictures everytime your Facebook Marketplace ad expires? This python script solves the problem.

How to use:
copy the Change_Hashcode_for_image.py to the folder where the image/s exist.
inside Change_Hashcode_for_image.py: change the variable input_file_path to the image name.
run the script using python3.

This can be used for other purposes. It essentially changes 1 random byte in the input file, which changes the hash of the output file. The hash is used to ban duplicate ads in websites like Facebook Marketplace.
